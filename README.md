# Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline

## Overview
In this project, I built a **city skyline** to learn and demonstrate the use of **CSS variables**. CSS variables allow you to define reusable values for styles, making it easier to manage and update the design across your website. By building a city skyline, I learned how to configure and apply these variables to create a consistent, flexible, and maintainable layout.

## Project Details
- **Project Type**: City Skyline Design  
- **Purpose**: Learn and practice the use of CSS variables to manage and reuse styles efficiently.  
- **Skills Learned**: CSS Variables, Custom Properties, Responsive Design, Layout Design

## Features
- **CSS Variables**: Defined custom properties (CSS variables) to manage color, size, and layout properties, making the code more efficient and easier to modify.  
- **City Skyline Layout**: Designed a creative and visually appealing city skyline with buildings, windows, and sky elements.  
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the city skyline looks great on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- **Easy to Update**: By using CSS variables, changing the look of the entire skyline can be done with a few edits to the variable values.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used to create the structure of the city skyline, including the buildings, sky, and other visual elements.  
- **CSS**: Used to style the skyline and apply CSS variables for managing styles.
